3.3. Chairperson. The Steering Committee will have a Chairperson whose responsibilities include leading the Steering Committee, organizing meetings, organizing and recording voting and ballots, determining consensus, coordinating appeals, identifying new Working Groups, tracking Working Group progress, ensuring Working Groups meet their goals, publishing and maintaining specifications, and any other activities Approved by the Steering Committee. The Chairperson may delegate responsibilities to another party. The Steering Committee may Approve a new Chairperson.

4.2. Appeals. Steering Committee decisions may be appealed by issuing a written appeal to the Chairperson, and that appeal will be considered by the Chairperson and the Steering Committee in good faith. The Chairperson will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

4.3. Notifications and Electronic Voting. The Chairperson is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Steering Committee subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least thirty days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least seven days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than seven days. These notification requirements with respect to the Steering Committee may be overridden upon unanimous consent of the Steering Committee members that have attended and participated in at least two of the last three meetings of the Steering Committee.

5. Due Process. The oneAPI Community Forum adheres to consensus-based due process, including openness, balance, adequate notice and review periods, and fair and impartial consideration of views and objections.

6. Working Groups. The Steering Committee may Approve the creation of one or more Working Groups upon the proposal of not less than three Active Contributors.  Membership is generally open to all.  Each Working Group will operate as set forth in its Working Group charter.  Governance is intended to be informal, with low overhead, while encouraging broad participation from the community (including technical advisors, implementers, and users).

6.1. Working Group Chair. The Steering Committee will Approve a chair for each Working Group.  Whenever possible, a Working Group Chair will be expected to chair the Working Group for the duration of the Working Group’s primary development task.  The Working Group Chair’s responsibilities will include tracking Working Group progress, ensuring Working Group meets its goals, editing specifications or portions of specifications developed by the Working Group, organizing Working Group regular meetings (monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly), issuing all notifications of meetings and votes, and uploading meeting minutes and managing the GitHub repository.

6.2. Decision Making by Consensus. The Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus, balancing the needs of the community. Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Working Group’s Active Contributors. Decision making will be transparent, with clear explanations and constructive feedback for rejected proposals.

6.3. Appeals. Working Group decisions may be appealed by issuing a written appeal to the Working Group Chair, and that appeal will be considered by the Working Group Chair in good faith. The Working Group Chair will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

6.4. Notifications and Electronic Voting. The Working Group Chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least thirty days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least seven days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than seven days. These notification requirements may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Active Contributors.

6.5. Deliverable Development Process.

6.5.1. Pre-Draft. Any Working Group member may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Deliverable of that Working Group. The Working Group chair will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.  

6.5.2. Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved by the Active Contributors of that Working Group to become a Draft Deliverable. Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Deliverable, the Draft Deliverable becomes the basis for all going forward work on that deliverable.

6.5.3. Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its deliverable as described in the Working Group charter, it will progress its Draft Deliverable to “Working Group Approved” status.

6.5.4. Final Approval. Upon a Draft Deliverable reaching Working Group Approved status, the Working Group Chair will present that Working Group Approved Draft Deliverable to the Steering Committee for consideration. Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, that Draft Deliverable will be designated a “oneAPI Approved Deliverable.”

6.5.5. Publication and Submission. Upon the designation of a oneAPI Approved Deliverable, the Steering Committee Chairperson will publish the oneAPI Approved Deliverable in a manner agreed upon by the Steering Committee (i.e., project participant-only location, publicly available location, project maintained website, project member website, etc.). The publication of a oneAPI Approved Deliverable in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms under which the oneAPI Approved Deliverable and/or source code is being made available.

6.5.6. Submissions to Standards Bodies. No Draft Deliverable or oneAPI Approved Deliverable may be submitted to another organization without Approval by the Steering Committee. Upon Approval by the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee Chairperson will manage the submission of the applicable Draft Deliverable or oneAPI Approved Deliverable to the designated standards development organization.

7. Non-Confidential, Restricted Disclosure. Information disclosed in connection with the oneAPI Community Forum and any Working Group activity, including but not limited to meetings, contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, participants may not make any public disclosures of that information without the Approval of the Steering Committee or Working Group, as applicable, authorizing that disclosure.

8. Disclaimers for Distributions. Any distributions of technical information to third parties must include a notice materially similar to the following: “THESE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” The parties expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the materials.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each participant agrees not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed among competitors.
