 oneAPI Community Forum Governance
==================================

The oneAPI Community Forum aims to bring individuals and
organizations together to:

  accelerated computing
* Foster open-source implementations of the specification

The oneAPI Community Forum intends to use a light weight model
of governance to facilitate straightforward collaboration for
the oneAPI specification and the open source implementations.
