 oneAPI Community Forum
================================

The oneAPI Community Forum exists to define a standards-based,
cross-architecture open specification for accelerated computing and
to foster the open-source implementations of the specification.

More information can be found at oneapi.io_.

This repository hosts notes and presentation materials from the
oneAPI Community Forum meetings.  The meetings are open and comprised
of experts from industry, government, and academia that help guide
the oneAPI specification.

The policies and governance processes are also available on this repo.

The community is invited to join the meetings, review the `oneAPI
Specification`_, and read the information in this repo. Contributions
can be made by joining the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or by
posting comments or questions as GitHub issues. General questions can
go to this repo and issues specific to parts of the specification can
go to the `Specification repo`_.

To be notified of new meeting notes, become a watcher of this repo. If
you have a question about how to join the SIGs, email
`oneapi@codeplay.com`_.

the organization and processes.
