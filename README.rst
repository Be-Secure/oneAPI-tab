 oneAPI Community Forum
================================

This repository hosts notes and presentation materials from the
oneAPI Community Forum meetings.  The meetings are open and comprised 
of industry experts that help guide the oneAPI specification.  More 
information on oneAPI can be found at `oneapi.com <https://oneapi.com>`__.

The community is invited to join the conversation by reviewing
the `oneAPI Specification <https://spec.oneapi.com>`__, as well as the

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or by posting comments or questions as

specific to parts of the specification can go to the `Specification 
repo<https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneapi-spec>`__.
